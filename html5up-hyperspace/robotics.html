                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Ever since I was in middle school, I knew that I wanted to have a future in engineering or computer science. A good portion of this came from my engineering teacher in middle school, Mr. Tisbert. He was very meticulous about everything, but everything was perfect and was really fun and inspired me to try and learn more about engineering and technology. Another portion of inspiration came from my friend Daniel Ivanovich, who got me into software and was the reason I joined the robotics club.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">The robotics club gave me hands on experience with a lot of hardware and electrical hardware. It truly brought out the passion that I had for engineering. Everything from the planning to the building to the testing intrigued me and made me want to continue in the field. Building the robots and actually being able to get involved in all of the processes of the construction was very interesting and helped me see things in a different light. What opened my eyes even more was being able to go to Detroit and seeing all the different and unique designs of the robots there. The minds of so many people coming together and challenging each other made me want to see what more the future holds in engineering and tech.</p>
