                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">I have been taking taekwondo since I was 5, about the same time I started learning the piano. I was always a quiet kid, but even at a young age I kept focus on what we were supposed to do. I have been studying at Kwon's Martial Arts in Tewskbury MA, and they have taught me a lot about life. Martial arts in general keep focus on the mind and body, with the addition of self defence. We have golden rules that formed me by following them and some of the important ones are self discipline, self control, respect for others and perseverance.</p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px;">With the rules we also follow the 5 codes of taekwondo, keeping the spirit, humility, integrity, concentration and justice. These are more for in the class, but still can be applied to everyday life. It took a while until I truly understood these rules and codes, but then I really tried to take it to heart and implement it into my own life. After taking classes for so long, I am currently a 3rd degree blackbelt, so I am eligable to instruct the classes. This has really helped improve my leadership abilities and improve my confidence in everyday life. Though I still have a lot to improve, I believe that taekwondo really helped to grow and develop me.</p>
